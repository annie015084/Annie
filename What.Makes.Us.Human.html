  <p> Humanity has been on this Earth for a very short amount of time. 
    In this short amount of time, we have created skyscrapers and cars that run on their own. 
    Yet, we are the ones tha thave been on the Earth the shortest. 
    Many don't see birds that make roads, or bears that make boats. 
    But, what makes humans special? Why and how are we different? </p>
